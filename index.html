      <p>
        I’m Aadit Rao, a a fourth-year Computer Science student studying at UBC with a minor in Mathematics. 
        My technical focus is performance-focused software in C/C++ and Python, and I’m interested in game engine & 
        real-time graphics, systems/performance programming, and quantitative finance engineering. Outside of programming, 
        my interests span across aviation, gaming, motorsports, and travelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is a curated selection of projects I’ve built and am proud of. It spans across custom OS kernels, C++ libraries, 
        game development, and quantitative finance work, including both completed projects and ones I’m actively developing as I explore new technologies.
